Given an array A of integers, a ramp is a tuple (i, j) for which i < j and A[i] <= A[j].  
The width of such a ramp is j - i.
Find the maximum width of a ramp in A.  If one doesn't exist, return 0.

Input Description:
A of array in integers 

Output Description:
the maximum width of a ramp in A

Sample input:
9 8 1 0 1 9 4 0 4 1

Sample Output:
7

Explanation:
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): A[2] = 1 and A[9] = 1.

Sample Input:
8 7 6 4 3 9
